The core Phosphor widget class.

[API Docs](http://phosphorjs.github.io/phosphor-widget/api/)

Phosphor widgets provide several useful behaviours:

- **Widget Hierarchy** - A widget is a JS object which wraps a DOM node and
  establishes a live parent-child relationship. While this may seem trivial,
  it allows for the implementation of advanced message passing and notifcation
  behaviors, and provides a sane pattern for component reuse.

- **Messages** - Standard messages include show/hide, attach/detach, resize,
  and close, to name just a few. Desktop GUI toolkits have had these for ages,
  but they are missing from the DOM. These sorts of messages are critical for
  creating a desktop-like experience in the browser. Users can also define
  their own custom messages to support advanced behavior.

- **Unopinionated Design** - *Any* DOM content can be added to a widget.
  [Examples](https://phosphorjs.github.io/examples.html) exist for React
  and others, but the `node` attribute of a `Widget` is just a standard
  DOM node, so content generated by nearly any framework can be hosted
  by a widget.

Usage Examples
--------------

**Note:** This module is fully compatible with Node/Babel/ES6/ES5. Simply
omit the type declarations when using a language other than TypeScript.

A `Widget` is the base class of the phosphor widget hierarchy. A `Panel` is
a convenient Widget subclass which acts as a container for child widgets.
Adding widgets to a panel is simple:

```typescript
let panel = new Panel();
let child1 = new Widget();
let child2 = new Widget();
panel.addChild(child1);
panel.addChild(child2);
```

A more realistic scenario would involve custom widgets:

```typescript
class LogWidget extends Widget {
  ...
}

class ControlsWidget extends Widget {
  ...
}

let logPanel = new Panel();
let log = new LogWidget();
let controls = new ControlsWidget();
logPanel.addChild(log);
logPanel.addChild(controls);
```

A `Widget` has a `node` property, which is a standard DOM node. For simple
UIs or custom generated content, the content nodes can be added directly to
the widget's `node`:

```typescript
let widget = new Widget();
let div = document.createElement('div');
widget.node.appendChild(div);
```

A `Widget` also inherits from
[NodeWrapper](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor-nodewrapper),
which means setting the node id and toggling CSS classes is simple:

```typescript
let widget = new Widget();
widget.id = 'main';
widget.addClass('foo');
widget.addClass('bar');
widget.removeClass('foo');
widget.toggleClass('bar', false);
```

A widget can be attached to the DOM with the `attach` method, which ensures
that the proper attachment messages are dispatched to the widget hierarchy.

```typescript
let widget = new Widget();
widget.attach(document.body);
```

Likewise, a widget can be detached from the DOM with the `detach` method,
though it is more common to simply `dipose` of the widget.

```typescript
let widget = new Widget();
widget.attach(document.body);

// sometime later...
widget.detach();

// or almost equivalently
widget.dispose();
```

The `Widget` class forms the foundation for building complex and custom
widgets, while the `AbstractPanel` and `Panel` subclasses make it simple to
create container widgets which cover a vast swath of use cases. The amount of
flexibility offered by these base classes means the user can create nearly any
application using content generated by nearly any framework. The PhosphorJS
project provides several useful widgets and layout panels out of the box.
